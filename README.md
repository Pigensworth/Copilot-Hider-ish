Just a simple scrolling script made by ChatGPT to stop always accidentally scroll up to the copilot thingy in Edge.

## Warning
It may jitter if you keep trying to scroll up, so if that bugs you then don't do it. Even if it doesn't bug it's kinda usless...

## Installation
#### The following instructions are for someone that doesn't know how to load their own extension. If you already know how then just skip the instructions and load the subfolder called 'Extension'.

To install this extension click on the blue code button and click 'Download ZIP'. Once it's downloaded select the folder, rightclick, and select 'extract all'. While it's extracting go to Edge and click on the three dots on the top right. Click 'Extensions' then 'Manage Extensions' in the popup. On the left side turn on develeper mode, then hit 'load unpacked.' Navigate to the extracted folder and continue into each subfolder until you come to one called 'Extension'. Select that folder and hit enter. Now it should work!
